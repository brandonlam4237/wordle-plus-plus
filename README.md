# Wordle++

https://wordlepp.netlify.app/

The sequel to the game that no one but me asked for. Introducing Wordle++, it's Wordle but with one more letter. All the fun of the original game now with 20% more letters. 

Built with React, and styled with SASS. The game fetches its word data from my backend JSON server hosted through heroku. <br>
